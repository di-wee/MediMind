# MediMind: Smart Medication Reminder

## ü©∫ Project Overview

**MediMind** is a smart medication reminder platform aimed at improving medication adherence for elderly and chronic patients in Singapore. By integrating mobile and web technologies with machine learning, MediMind offers personalized medication reminders, visual recognition of medications, and real-time oversight for caregivers and doctors.

## üö® Problem Statement

As Singapore moves towards a super-aged society, chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease require complex medication regimens. However, non-adherence due to forgetfulness, side effects, and low health literacy remains a critical issue, often placing undue stress on caregivers. Existing reminder apps are too complex and fail to contextualize the importance of adherence or track intake history. MediMind addresses this gap with a user-friendly, intelligent, and caregiver-integrated solution.
